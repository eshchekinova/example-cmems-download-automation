Overview

An automated data uploading (https://github.com/eshchekinova/example-cmems-download-automation) included two steps: 

(1) data uploading and extraction,

(2) format conversion from netcdf to tabular .csv.

Description

For real-time uploading from the Copernicus Ocean website (https://resources.marine.copernicus.eu/?option=com_csw&task=results) the data are selected according to user-given parameters :

    • spatial domain
    
    • depth
    
    • time span
    
    • variables
      
To extract the data we use motuclient Python library and bash. Two models are used :

    • GLOBAL_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_PHY
    
    • GLOBAL_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_WAV

The data are uploaded using netcdf format into associated name directories:

    • name_dir_out_nc="$(pwd)/GLOBAL_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_PHY_NC"
    
    • name_dir_out_nc="$(pwd)/GLOBAL_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_WAV_NC"
      
For a time step a separated .nc file is created named according to selected model and time stamp:    
    • file_out=”GLOBAL_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_PHY_001_24-TDS_2021-01-23_21:30:00:00"
    
    • file_out=”GLOBAL_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_WAVE_001_27-TDS_2021-01-23_15:00:00:00"

To convert  data to tabular .csv format we use Python scripts and create a separate directories for corresponding models:    
    • name_dir_out_csv="$(pwd)/GLOBAL_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_PHY_CSV"
    
    • name_dir_out_csv="$(pwd)/GLOBAL_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_WAV_CSV"

Analogously, the directories contain for every time step an csv file with the name according to model and time stamp:

    •  file_out=”GLOBAL_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_PHY_001_24-TDS_2021-01-23_21:30:00:00"
    
    •  file_out=”GLOBAL_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_WAVE_001_27-TDS_2021-01-23_15:00:00:00"



Usage

To initiate an automated data retrieval copy .sh and .py files to your current directory my_dir_name make .sh files executable (chmod +x  <name_file.sh>) and run the commands:

./MotuClCallPhysModel.sh 

./MotuClCallWaveModel.sh 

for retrieving current and waves data accordingly.

After the data are uploaded run the python scripts to convert tdata to .csv format by entering commands:

python NetCDF2CSVPhysModel.py

python NetCDF2CSVWaveModel.py
